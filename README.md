# Heart Disease Diagnostc Analysis
## About this project 
The World Health Organization (WHO) reports a staggering 17.9 million deaths annually from cardiovascular diseases, making them the leading cause of death and costing a hefty $272 billion globally. The good news: 80% of these premature deaths are preventable through healthy choices and early detection. This analysis could become a significant step towards the early detection.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of heart disease diagnostic factors using a dataset containing various patient features. The goal is to derive meaningful insights, identify potential risk factors, and contribute to the broader understanding of cardiovascular health.
The raw dataset comprises 1025 rows and 14 columns, with key variables including 'age', 'sex', 'cp', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg', 'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal', and 'target'. 

## Recommendations Based on Analysis
Considering that the age group of 40-70 years exhibits the highest incidence of reported heart-related discomfort, individuals within this demographic should prioritize lifestyle modifications. Medical institutions can enhance and allocate their services to cater specifically to this age group.
Any abnormalities detected in crucial features, particularly in Max Heart Rate (Thalach), Cholesterol, and Exercise Capacity Score, should prompt individuals to seek a medical checkup for a comprehensive diagnosis of potential causes.

## Addressing Potential Areas for Further Research 
It's essential to approach the analysis cautiously, acknowledging certain limitations in the dataset, such as its relatively small size, the presence of binary variables (e.g., 'target,' 'sex'), and potential biases. Additionally, my analysis lacks domain-specific expertise.
For the 'target,' the general assumption is that 0 represents 'No heart disease,' while 1 indicates 'Heart Disease.'
Regarding 'sex,' the general assumption is that 0 corresponds to 'Female,' and 1 corresponds to 'Male.'.

## Conclusion 
This project aimed to meticulously clean and preprocess the dataset, conducting a thorough analysis using pertinent features and metrics. The goal was to unveil potential patterns and insights, fostering a comprehensive understanding to optimize the heart's health conditions.
